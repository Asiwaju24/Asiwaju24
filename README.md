# Taslim Olaniyan (Asiwaju24)

Hi — I'm Taslim Olaniyan (GitHub: @Asiwaju24). I am a third-year Computer Science & Education student from the University Of Ilorin with a long-standing background in Python dating back to secondary school. I build backend systems, work on computer vision projects, and develop polished frontends when needed.

## About Me
- Third-year Computer Science & Education student
- Python programmer since secondary school with experience writing clean and maintainable code
- Focus areas: Backend development, Computer Vision, Web Scraping, and full-stack prototyping
- Currently expanding my knowledge in Neural Networks to support my Computer Vision work

---

## Primary Tech Stack
**Backend**
- Django, Django REST Framework (API architecture, authentication, serializers)

**Frontend**
- React (component-driven design, hooks, state management)

**Machine Learning & Computer Vision**
- PyTorch, OpenCV (model development, training workflows, inference pipelines)

**Web Scraping**
- Requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy (extraction, data cleaning, automation)

**Tools & DevOps**
- Git, SQL, pandas, NumPy

---

## Areas I Work On
- Designing and building RESTful APIs with Django and DRF
- Developing Computer Vision systems: detection, classification, OCR, and model integration
- Delivering full-stack prototypes: scraping → data pipeline → models → APIs → frontends
- Deploying models and backend services for demos or small-scale production environments

---

## Projects and Code Samples
Visit my GitHub repositories for practical examples, including:
- Django-based API services with authentication and CRUD operations
- React applications that interact with backend APIs
- PyTorch computer vision prototypes and training scripts
- Automated web scrapers and structured data pipelines

---

## Learning Goals
- Strengthen practical understanding of Neural Networks for CV applications
- Improve deployment workflows and scalable inference setups
- Enhance end-to-end system design skills, from data collection to production-ready interfaces

---

## Collaboration and Contact
I am open to collaborating on Computer Vision, backend engineering, and full-stack development projects.
